# Linked Lists

1. Implemenet LinkedList class that wraps the Node class (just one member variable the head Node)
 will help to resolve issues with multiple references to the linked list.

2. The "runner" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems. The "fast" node
 might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that the
 "slow" node iterates through.

3. You can add and remove items by O(1), but if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list,
 you will need to iterate through K elements.
