// Intersection: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
// Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference,
// not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node
// (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.

// Hints: #20, #45, #55, #65, #76, #93, #111, #120, #129
