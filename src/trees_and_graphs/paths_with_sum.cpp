// Paths with Sum: You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which
// might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a
// given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
// (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
// Hints: #6, #14, #52, #68, #77, #87, #94, #103, #108, #115

// Test
